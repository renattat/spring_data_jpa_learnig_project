# spring_data_jpa_learnig_project
This is my learing project for Spring Data JPA.

Throughout this course, I've built domain model entities 
and repositories for a simple e-commerce application.

n typical three-layer Spring boot application architecture, 
I've created three layers - Controller, Service, and DAO/Repository layer.

- How to Use Spring Data JPA in the Spring Boot Application

- 4 Types of Primary key Generation Strategies - AUTO, IDENTITY, SEQUENCE, and TABLE

- Spring Data JPA Repository Interfaces and Its Hierarchy

- Important Spring Data JPA Repository Methods (CRUD Operations)

- How to Create Query Methods or Finder Methods Using Method Names

- How to Create JPQL and Native SQL Queries Using @Query Annotation
and with Named Queries

- How to Implement Pagination and Sorting Using Spring Data JPA

- JPA/Hibernate Mapping Using Spring Data JPA: One-to-One, One to Many, Many to Many 
 
- JPA Cascade Types and Fetch Types (EAGER and LAZY)

- Transaction Management with Spring Data JPA
